# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains an implementation of various machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. The algorithms are designed to provide a clear understanding of their underlying principles and functionalities.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Binary Bayes Classifiers**  
   Implemented learning algorithms based on Maximum Likelihood estimation for binary classification tasks.

2. **Multiclass Bayes Classifiers**  
   Developed algorithms to handle multiple classes using Maximum Likelihood estimation.

3. **Overfitting and Underfitting Analysis in Regression**  
   A comprehensive analysis to demonstrate the concepts of overfitting and underfitting in regression models.

4. **Bayesian Regression**  
   Implementation of Bayesian methods for regression tasks, providing a probabilistic framework for inference.

5. **Logistic Regression**  
   Developed from scratch, this model is used for binary classification problems.

6. **Decision Tree**  
   A simple yet powerful algorithm for classification and regression tasks, built from fundamental principles.

7. **Random Forest**  
   An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy.

8. **AdaBoost**  
   An implementation of the Adaptive Boosting algorithm, which combines weak classifiers to create a strong classifier.

9. **Lasso Regression**  
   Developed an implementation of Lasso regression, which includes L1 regularization to reduce overfitting.

## Usage

You can use these implementations as a reference or as a foundation for your own machine learning projects. Each algorithm is modular and can be easily integrated into larger systems.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
