# Machine_learning_algorithm_implementation
In this Ipynb file I have implemented various machine learning algorithm from scratch.Please use them as per your help and let me know if there is any update required.
The Algirthm are implemented above are:
 1)Learning Binary Bayes Classifiers from data with Max. Likelihood
 2)Learning Multiclass Bayes Classifiers from data with Max. Likeli.
 3)Analyse overfitting and underfitting in Regression
 4)Bayesian Regression
 5)Logistic Regression
 6)Decision Tree
 7)Random Forest
 8)Adaboost
 9)Lasso Regression
